# Etsy Customer Reviews of Children's Books Analysis

An ongoing project to scrape and analyze customer reviews of children's books from Etsy. The project uses Jupyter Notebook, specifically Python- Beautiful Soup for web scraping, SQL Server for data cleaning, and cleaned data export to an Excel file. Additionally, sentiment analysis creates word clouds for positive and negative reviews. The ultimate goal is to analyze the sentiment data and relate it to other relevant data for deeper insights.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on scraping customer reviews of children's books from the Etsy website. The data is collected using Python and Beautiful Soup, leveraging their capabilities to extract information from web pages. The scraped data is processed, cleaned, and stored in a SQL Server database for further analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Export

After scraping the data, SQL Server cleans and transforms the dataset. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and performing necessary data-wrangling tasks. The cleaned data is then exported to an Excel file for easier accessibility and analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis

One of the main aspects of the project is sentiment analysis of customer reviews. This analysis aims to identify the positive and negative sentiments expressed in the reviews. Using appropriate Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and libraries, sentiment scores are assigned to each review. These scores generate word clouds to visualize the most common positive and negative sentiments found in the reviews.

## Future Plans

This project is an ongoing endeavor, with several planned steps to enhance its scope and depth. Some of the upcoming plans include:

- Exploring advanced sentiment analysis techniques, such as aspect-based sentiment analysis or emotion detection.
- Integrating additional data sources to enrich the analysis.
- Creating visualizations and dashboards to present the findings more effectively and informally.
- Conducting statistical analysis and data mining to uncover patterns, correlations, or trends in customer reviews data.
- Documenting the project in more detail, including code explanations, step-by-step guides, and best practices for reproducibility.
